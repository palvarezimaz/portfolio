      <h1>About me</h1>
      <p>
        Having spent 10+ years teaching and working for renowned companies, I’ve
        relocated to Australia and career shifted, returning to the world of
        coding and development. I believe that we can all be positive and
        constructive individuals that try to make each others’ lives better, and
        this idea encourages me to do my best. Armed with an eclectic skill set
        gained from my educational and enterprise background and a passion for
        technology that manifested itself in my teenage adventures with
        Assembler (like a Summer love), in hex-editing save games files (to
        finally beat that final boss), or developing websites (thank you,
        Dreamweaver!), I am happy to perform my role as a positive and
        constructive individual being a Software Engineer, dressed up with
        fundamental values such as communication, teamwork, resilience and
        critical thinking. At the moment, I’m learning a lot in the Software
        Engineering Immersive program at General Assembly Australia. I am keen
        to find a meaningful position where I can continue my education and
        satisfy my endless curiosity in this fantastic field. Feel free to
        contact me, and don’t forget to visit my GitHub repo to check my
        projects. Salud!
